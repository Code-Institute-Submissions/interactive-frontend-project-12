## About 

Project Milestone Two - Code Institute

[Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) is a  memory game inspired by a classic eletronic game made by Ralph H.
Composed with four playable buttons with different colors (red, green, blue and yellow), players have to follow a set of different
flash ramdom crescent sequence in order to win. 

### Goal

The main goal of this project is to reproduce the same logic, layout and patterns the Simon Game has with Javascript.
Being suitable to be played on the internet.

### Functionality 
The game layout is composed by two different sections settings and the four playable buttons. 
Where the settings are composed by **Score Counter**, **Strict checkbox** and **Power Checkbox**. 
The four playable buttons are composed by four colors **red**, **blue**, **yellow** and **green** 
in which displays a brighter color in conjunction with a sound.

#### Settings

The functionality of the three elements of settings are correlated each other as well as with the four playable buttons.
For instance, all of them are initiated being called into the code by its id with a query selector. 

 **Start Button** 
```
const startButton = document.querySelector("#startButton");
```
and added its ```const``` into a event listener as a result: 
```
startButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (on || win) {
    play(); 
  }
});
```
**Power Checkbox** and **Score** 

As mentioned before, the correlation in the settings section is between the power button ```turnOnButton``` 
and score ```turnCounter```.
```
turnOnButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (turnOnButton.checked == true) {
    on = true;
    turnCounter.innerHTML = "-";
  }
  else {
    on = false;
    turnCounter.innerHTML = "";
    clearColor();
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  }
});
```
As soon as the Power checkbox is clicked the Score element into the section initiates with a ```-``` 
in which begins to increase in number based on turns made by players success in the game.

**Strict Checkbox**

The strict checkbox is the element in which doesn't allow players repeat the same level again multiples times. 
For instance, if a players is on the level 7 in the game and miss a sequence button he can repeat the same level, 
however, with the strict checkbox activated the player will not be able to play on the same level again having 
to continue the game from level-1 again.

The strict checkbox is called into the code by its id and added into an event listener:

```
const strictButton = document.querySelector("#strict");
```
```
strictButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (strictButton.checked == true) {
    strict = true;
  }
  else {
    strict = false;
  }
});
```
The only way the ```strictButton``` is added is into the ```check()``` function to provide its fucntionality.

#### Four playable buttons

The four playable buttons of the Simon game is the place in which all the game logic is joined together. 
All of the four button are displayed into the code by its ```id``` and displayed into a ```const``` within ```script.js```.
In addition, the four buttons are followed by its colors variances as well as its sounds as displayed below:

```
//const based by each button.
const btnBlue = document.querySelector("#btnBlue");//Button blue
const btnGreen = document.querySelector("#btnGreen");//Button green
const btnRed = document.querySelector("#btnRed");//Button red 
const btnYellow = document.querySelector("#btnYellow");//Button yellow
```
```
//variables for each color.
let blueBtnAudio = new Audio('https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound1.mp3');//audio for button blue
let redBtnAudio = new Audio('https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound2.mp3');//audio for button red 
let yellowBtnAudio = new Audio('https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound3.mp3');//audio for button yellow
let greenBtnAudio = new Audio('https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound4.mp3');//audio for button green
```
Moreover, with all the four buttons declared within the code, an event listener is made for each button to 
represent its effect into the game.
```
btnGreen.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (on) {
    playerOrder.push(1);
    check();
    first();
    if (!win) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        clearColor();
      }, 300);
    }
  }
});
```
Using the ```btnGreen``` as a example you can see its functionality. Using conditionals the event describes 
the player order index to be used with the game loop as ```1```, with the ```check()``` fucntion that gives the player choice verification
as well as its own function called ```first()``` that all the other three buttons/colors have. The ```clearColor()``` function, 
for instance, is the set of colors for each button in wich will display each button with its initial color.

The other four function ```play()```, ```gameTurn()```, ```check()``` and ```win()``` are the main batchs that will manage all 
of the event listeners, small button functions, loops as well as whether you lose or win. 

### Initiation

To play the game, players need to 1st press the ```Power``` checkbox on the top-right hand side and after press the ```start``` button. 
as soon as they are pressed the loop will begin on the four button and the ```Score`` will initiate counting.

## Bringing Simons Game to another level.

- Landing-page like game to introduce it for those who don't know what the game is like.
- Three different sections 1st: Main, 2nd: parallax, 3rd: The game.
